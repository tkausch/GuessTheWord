Wordle is a word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and 
published by The New York Times Company since 2022. Players have six attempts to guess a 
five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating 
when letters match or occupy the correct position. 

This is a simple Swift implementation based on SwiftUI.
